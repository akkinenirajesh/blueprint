# Welcome
Hi, I am Rajesh Akkineni, ~43y. I live in Hyderabad, India. For a long time my number one priority in life has been health. I don't want to be sick ever. And I believe that prevention is better then cure.

This site is my attempt to follow [Bryan Johnson's Bluprint](https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.co). I don't intend to follow everything he does. But I will attemt to do as much as I can.

Talk to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/akkinenirajesh) or [Telegram](https://t.me/rajeshakkineni). I am also starting a Telegram group for Blueprint Indian followers. [Join here](https://t.me/+D7RjbwoPsPpkYjBl).

Lets Start.

## Sleep
I go to bed around 9:30 to 10:30PM and wake up around 5:30 to 6:30AM. I tried to use some sleep trackers, but I don't like to wear anything while sleeping.
Also there is no need to test it, as I know there is need for improvement. No point in measuring everything, when it doesn't result in any action. I apply this principle to everything in life. 

Also I limit blue light exposure to my eyes. I were blue light blocking glasses after sunset. And use related settings in mobile and laptop. I avoid turning on tube lights after sunset. If needed I use incandescent bulbs. I do take [Melatonin](#melatonin) sometimes, I will talk about it in detail there.

## Exercise
Going to gym every day(7 days a week) from 6:30 AM to 8:AM. 

There is a lot to improve in there. I will update details soon.

## Food
I do intermittent fasting. I eat only between 9AM to 3PM. I eat only two meals a day. No dairy products, no sugar, no processed foods. I am mostly hungry every night. One bad habit I am still having is eating [Mysure Bonda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2Z3X2Z2Z3Y) sometimes for breakfast. I am trying to cut down on it.  

### Breakfast
Usually Idly, Pesarattu or Utappam. Sometimes Mysure Bonda. I do add olive oil to Idlies. And there might be some coconut chatney. I eat moong sprouts, carrot, and boiled beens. They help me control my glucose effect of the breakfast.

### Lunch
2 to 4 Curries mixed with some ghee or oilive oil and a bit of rice. All combined it will be around 750grams(including water content). In that rice will be 20 to 30%. Still using white rice. But plan is to switch to brown rice soon. In curries usually one will be with some Dal, and some leafy greens. I eat some kind of friut after lunch. Based on season, it will be either Mango, Sapota, Guava or Watermelon. 

## Suppliments

I am planning to take all those suppliments mentioned in [Bryan Johnson's Bluprint](https://blueprint.bryanjohnson.co). Here I will list all of them, cost of each one, and where I buy them. 


### Upon waking

Actually I don't take anything upon waking. I take them just before breakfast, which is after gym.

| Suppliment | Cost | Source | Notes |
|------------|------|--------|-------|
| Acarbose 200mg (Rx) | ₹40 | We can find in any pharmacy. As it is prescription medicine, you wont get it online without prescription. | Not taking right now. 50mg Tablet is around ₹10. So I need to take 4 in the morning and 4 with lunch. That will be ₹80 per day. :-( Hopefully I don't need to take that many, as I dont comsume as many colories as Bryan does. |
| Ashwagandha 600mg | ₹5.15 |[Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B08KZX1SF2) | Taking only 500mg.|
| B Complex .25 pill M/Th | ₹2 + ₹5.25 | Beplex Forte + [Carbamide Forte Vitamin B12](https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B09DKW81VV) | I am taking Beplex Forte. You will get in any pharmacy. It is not exact composition as the one Bryan is taking. It got very less B12 in it. So I have combined another B12 suppliment. Assuming this will cover his weekly B12 Shot|
| BroccoMax 250mg | ₹0 | -NA- | This Brocoli stuff seems not avilable here. So not taking any.|
| C 500mg | ₹1.6 | Pharmacy | You will get Limcee or other similar brand. Did C Vitamin costs changed recently? Now it is showing ₹1.6, and recently I purchased for more than ₹5, What is going on?|
| Ca-AKG 1 gram | ₹0 | -NA- | No idea, what this is. Will check soon.|
| Cocoa Flavanols 500mg | ₹0 | -NA- | No idea, not using it. |
| D-3 2,000 IU | ₹0 | | Right now I am taking Monthly 60,000IU one. I have more fat, than Bryan, So I don't have to take it every day, I hope there will be some store in me. |
| DHEA 25mg | ₹0 | -NA- | No Idea, not taking this.|
| E 67mg | ₹2.5 | Pharmacy | Evion 200mg is the least we can get. So can we take once in 3 days? In that case It will be around ₹1 per day. Super cheep. ChatGPT says, it does get stored. And I think little fluctuations is okey. |
| EPA 500mg with vitamin E 5mg | ₹0 | | I have not decided which one to buy yet. Things are not |
| Garlic 2.4g equivalent | ₹0 | -NA-| Do we need this? Don't we already eat log of garlic? Per day 5g? Not sure.|
| Garlic 1.2g (kyolic) | ₹0 | -NA- | Not sure, what is this? How is it different? Garlic is cheep enough for us to consume directly. Do we need to buy suppliments? |
| Ginger Root 2.2g | ₹0 |-NA- | I usually dont sollow garlic in food. Not sure how to eat it. It is cheep enough for us, no need for supplimentation I guess.|
